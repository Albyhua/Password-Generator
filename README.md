# Password-Generator

## Description

I built a password generator that allows users to select specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, number, special characters) and password lengths from 8 to 128. The password generator will generate a strong password that fits the user's criteria. If the user does not care about the specificity of the password, selecting all will be the first option that will pop up and skip to the password length instead of the user selecting the four options altogether as a shortcut.
