# Password-Generator

## Description

I built a password generator that allows user to select specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, number, special characters) and password length from 8 to 128. The password generator will then generate a strong password that fits the user's crtieria. If the user wants does not care of the speficity of the password, select all will be the first option that will pop up and will then skip to the password length instead of the user selecting the four options altogether as a shortcut.
